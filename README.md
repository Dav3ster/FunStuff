# FunStuff

I am building this site to act as a magic the gathering deck builder, This is meant to be a fun tool
where one can build, and save deck ideas before constructing them for real. This app will be built using
react for the front end and mongo for the backend database, I plan to utilize MTG's open API to pull card
information from.
